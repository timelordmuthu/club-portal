# Nexus Event Portal - Tech Horizon 2026

Hey! This is my submission for the Nexus Club frontend task. I wanted to build something that wasn't just a boring form, so I went for a futuristic, "cyber" vibe with a lot of interactive elements.

## What I built
The goal was to create a smooth registration experience for the Tech Horizon 2026 event. Here’s a breakdown of what’s inside:

* **The Vibe:** I used a "Glassmorphism" design. It uses a lot of blurs and transparency to make it look modern.
* **The "Wow" Factor:** I added a 3D parallax effect on the main header—if you move your mouse around, the title actually tilts! I also added a pulsing neon logo and some background "blobs" to keep the page feeling alive.
* **Smart Form:** The form doesn't just wait for you to click submit. It checks your email and phone number while you type. I also added a progress bar at the top so users know how close they are to finishing.
* **The Countdown:** There's a live timer counting down to the event (March 15, 2026).

## My Process
1.  **Layout:** Started with a clean semantic structure (Header, Hero, Missions, Form, Footer).
2.  **Animations:** I used CSS Keyframes for the glitch effects and background movement so it stays fast without needing heavy libraries.
3.  **Logic:** Wrote the JavaScript to handle the real-time validation and the countdown math.

## Challenges I faced
Getting the 3D tilt effect to look smooth without making the text unreadable was a bit tricky. I had to play around with the perspective values in CSS to get it just right. I also spent some time making sure the mobile version didn't look cluttered since there's a lot of "glow" going on.
